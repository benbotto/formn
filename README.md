# Formn

Formn, pronounced foreman, is an object-relational mapper for Node.js. What's
the "F" stand for? It depends on your mood.

It's a fast, database-first ORM for projects written in TypeScript, and it uses
the data-mapper pattern.

Check out the
[documentation](https://benbotto.github.io/doc/formn/5.x.x/).  It
has a getting started guide, tutorials, and more.
